# Cisco-Networking-Project

### Network project using Cisco

I have created a Cisco network project, designing and configuring a network topology with multiple subnets. The network has a main IP address of 147.227.155.0/24, and the subnets are allocated to cover different infrastructure segments.

The topology includes routers, switches, servers (DHCP, DNS, WEB), and network devices such as computers, laptops, and a wireless access point. I have segmented the network based on the needs of each subnet, optimizing IP address allocation, routing, and connectivity.

To complete this project, I had to fulfill several technical requirements, including:

* Designing the network and correctly connecting cables

* Subnetting the given IP range and ensuring efficient address allocation

* Assigning static IP addresses and configuring DHCP for dynamic IP allocation

* Setting up default gateways and verifying inter-network connectivity via pinging

* Configuring routing (static or dynamic using RIP)

* Setting up and using DNS and a web server, ensuring accessibility from any machine

* Using minimal IP classes for inter-router connections

* Implementing NAT for network address translation

This project can be used for simulating a corporate network, testing routing configurations, and setting up essential network services. It showcases a solid 
understanding of network design, IP addressing, routing, and server configurations
